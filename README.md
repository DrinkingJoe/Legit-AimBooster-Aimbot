### BuT I dOnt KnoW hoW tO cOmpIle iT
Well, first of all, if that is the case, you shouldnt be here.  
Second of all, in the future I will add a .exe for you to simply doubleclikc. Note, that suprise suprise you wont be able to change anything, including screen size, making the aimbot more skillful while looking less human etc.

## Updates

## Issues  
- Depending on the size of your monitor, some thing may be broken, you will have to read the file and fix them, they should be easy enough to spot. 
- The aimbot doesent stop immidietly after pausing or exiting.  

If you find other issues, feel free to tell other people about them in the issues tab.
